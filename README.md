# Palindrome Checker

This project provides a simple web application that allows users to check if a word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequences of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.

## Features

- **Palindrome Verification**: Upon clicking the "Check" button, the application will verify if the entered text is a palindrome.
- **Results Display**: The result will be displayed on the webpage, informing the user whether the entered text is a palindrome or not.

## Technologies Used

- CSS: For styling the web page.
- JavaScript: For the application's functionality.
